### Minecraft Font Skull

The skull icon was manually recreated from the [minecraft](minecraft.net)'s [font](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Font)'s equivalent character for `☠`, colored `&7` or more accurately `§7` ingame. (`#AAAAAA` and `#2A2A2A`)

### An idea, minecraft-textures, and a font file walk into a bar..

Credit goes to [destruc7i0n](https://github.com/destruc7i0n) for..

* The idea behind recreating minecraft's crafting in html/css for the purpose of displaying crafting recipes. To be specific, the "Crafting Area" section on [crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca](https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/)

* minecraft-textures ( [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-textures) / [repostiory](https://github.com/destruc7i0n/minecraft-textures) ) which is a wonderful collection of all of the exact assets I needed, including some such as renders of the heads and blocks in the inventory that other similar packages didn't have. And credit to [minecraft](minecraft.net) for the assets themselves of course.

* A .woff font file containing the basic minecraft font.
